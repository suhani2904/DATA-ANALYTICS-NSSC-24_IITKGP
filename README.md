Objective of the Analysis: Data-Driven Classification of Hazardous Asteroids
The primary objective of this analysis is to use data analytics and machine learning techniques to determine the likelihood of an asteroid being hazardous to Earth based on various features provided in the dataset. By analysing these features, the goal is to develop predictive models that classify asteroids into hazardous and non-hazardous
